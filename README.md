# Alter_Kajiurago
Turning quasi-language used in Yuki Kajiura songs into actual, math-heavy and mystical language. 
Its main features:  
 - unusual morphology blending fusional, agglutinative and even mathe-magical features.
 - duality–heavy noun & verb grammar
 - light, melodic phonetics extensively using liquids and nasals with **CV(S)(C)** as basic cluster
 - multiple speech registers
 - ability to be written with multiple scripts (Latin alphabet with no special symbols, extended Madoka Witch Runes, adapted middle Hieratic script, and much MORE!)
 - NEW GRAMMAR CATEGORY – I call it „operators” atm, but it may change.
 - words are MOSTLY original rather than inspired, with exceptions and borrowings like: „ahriya” for graceful/glorious, „curimsenya” meaning **exactly** „trace of animal/vehicle that crawls”, „keteuro” for crown, „fumicye” meaning bookmworm (or friendly term for nerd) and Voyhimme meaning power/will/ability.
 - inclusive vs exclusive „we” in pronouns and persons (I miss it in so many real-life languages, ngl).
