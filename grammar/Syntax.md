Syntax usually follows SVO order **except** certain specific usecases – like casting spells or making *absolute and logical* statements.  
In that situation, order may switch to either VOS or OSV (the latter is actual „Yoda's speech” btw), and rely on alternative-aorist tense, system of mathematically–inspired „operators” + sometimes switch lexical registers.
