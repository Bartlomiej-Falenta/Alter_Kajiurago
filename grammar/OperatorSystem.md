# Operators

Operators... They are probably completely **new** grammar category, which probably only existed in other conlangs before – probably some obscure artlangs and loglangs?  
Essentially, they have **no meanning** themselves, but *heavily alter meanings* of verbs, nouns, adjectives and other speeah parts. As the category name suggests, it was inspired by operators in math, like matrices, derivatives, multiplications, inversions, mappings, etc.  
Hypothetically speaking, you can pronounce differantial equations even **verbally**.  
Operators take form of prefixes, sometimes can be doubled to denote applying operation many times, or combined to represent mixed operations.  
Example operators with their influence based on speech parts:
