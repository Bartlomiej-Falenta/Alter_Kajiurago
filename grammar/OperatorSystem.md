# Operators

Operators... They are probably completely **new** grammar category, which probably only existed in other conlangs before – probably some obscure artlangs and loglangs?  
Essentially, they have **no meaning** themselves, but *heavily alter meanings* of verbs, nouns, adjectives and other speeah parts. As the category name suggests, it was inspired by operators in math, like matrices, derivatives, multiplications, inversions, mappings, etc.  
Hypothetically speaking, you can pronounce differantial equations even **verbally**.  
Operators take form of prefixes, sometimes can be doubled to denote applying operation many times, or combined to represent mixed operations.  
Example operators with their influence based on speech parts (most names are borrowed or refernce-based):  
 – *lyo-*, inversion/negation: reflects or inverts meaning of noun, „reflects in time” meaning of verb, inverts or negates meaning of adjcetive;
 – *cla-*, 
 – *nab(i)-*, spatial differential: expresses spatial changes in word's meaning, in nouns it may emphasize that object has complex shape (both in good or bad contexts – it can describe buxom and attractive woman, as well as rough surface that can easily hurt you), while in verbs it'll usually refers to how action changes sorroundings or nearby areas – yet again, it can refer to swift tidying of messy room, but also to how a construction site damaged nearby woods;
 – *fidya(t)-*, temporal differential: in case of nouns will usually mean how object **changed with time**, e.g. person who matured or castle that turned into ruin, meanwhile in verbs it usually means how progress of action is fluently changing with time (e.g. referring to evolution of mankind or how football match quickly got lost by team which had advantage);
 – *dyer-*, derivation from other, original concept: in nouns, it'd obviuos (ie. father and son, one molecule derived from another), but in verbs it can mean action that either got caused by some other event (**not** necessarily in the **past**!) or action that originates in e.g. thought (premeditaded murder, but also invention that came from clever observation);
 – *omp(a)-*, difference intensification (name derived from opamps in analog electronics): verbs with this prefix can refer to processes of e.g. increasing inequality/political polarization, BUT also to iterative improvements of some machine – in case of nouns it's more tricky but usually means „those objects were different, but now they are completely opposite!”;
 – *trot(ya)-*, randomizer, predictor & combiner (name fittingly comes from Tarot): can be thought of as Bayesian filter applied to word's meaning [TO DO: ELABOARTE];
 – *suem(e)-*, integration or summation of many elements: nouns may refer to how objects collectively behave, and verbs how many different actions result in common goal/end;
 – *forr(i)-*, switching from progressive POV to frequential POV (Fourrier Transform lmao): instead of looking at verb/noun from perspective of progressive flow, it means looking at it from perspective of organized combination of how often various qualities occur/happen – IDC what this printer does (usually anything except printing), but what it is made of and how each of its parts contribute to its mechanism?;  
  
MORE TO COME!!!
