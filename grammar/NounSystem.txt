Nouns have both gender and class system (3 genders, 6 classe), but some classes allow for only two genders or don't have gender at all (except for artistic „genderization” in those noun classes). Also, same noun can change class depending on it's exact meaning or context, which is visible in grammar form of it.
Aside gender and class system, we have singular & plural numbers, with some sort of vestigial, third „uncountable” number occuring for some words in certain classes.
